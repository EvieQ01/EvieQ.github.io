## 2022 Recap

I enjoyed my life in my undergrad ðŸ¥°

These experiences are one of the most precious thing during my undergraduate study. 

We struggled in countless homework, yet we struggled to bring happiness to ourselves and to all.

### 2. Sports Participation
I love all kinds of sports - though I'm not an expert in them, but I enjoy being a part of them.
* Competed in John Ma Cup badminton competitions of female-doubles and mixed-doubles and won championship for the Department of Automation in 2021.
* Joined karate team, competed in John Ma Cup competition and got top-8 awards in individual and team events in 2020.

### 3. Research

* Out-of-Dynamics Imitation Learning from Multi-modal demonstrations --- with Jialong, Zhangjie, Prof. Long.

* Hybrid Dynamics-aware Offline-and-Online Reinforcement Learning --- with Haoyi, Shubham, Prof. Zhan.

### 4. Person I met

> Glad to work with these people, who had cheered me up and inspired me.

* Haoyi, Jianxiong, Zhe, ..., and Prof. Zhan
  <!-- They give me precious joyful moments in all the stress. I see passion and warmths, and I begin to believe that that's what scientific research can also be like. :) To gain some confidence in the fields we study, and feeling proud as well as humble for making a little contribution, no matter how little, but still as much as we could do within our capability. -->

* Prof. Ma, Prof. Jiang, and Shengquan.

  <!-- Thanks to them to give me a chance to get to know compu-Bio. Gap between solving real-world problems and developing better algorithms is HUGE. Hope to dig deeper in the latter field, so that one day I would know how to deal with the first. It is about thinking more orinially about science. :) -->

* Jialong

  <!-- Maybe he is the person I spent most time with and who always urged me about the research and scolded me the most, who always chase high efficiency and quality. This is another way of life that I admire --- pure love for truth and stability /peace.  -->

* Prof. Shang
