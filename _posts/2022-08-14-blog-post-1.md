### 2022 Recap

I enjoyed my life in my undergrad ðŸ¥°
#### 1. Students Festival
These experiences are one of the most precious thing during my undergraduate study. 

We struggled in countless homework, yet we struggled to bring happiness to ourselves and to all.

#### 2. Sports Participation
I love all kinds of sports - though I'm not an expert in them, but I enjoy being a part of them.
* Competed in John Ma Cup badminton competitions of female-doubles and mixed-doubles and won championship for the Department of Automation in 2021.
* Joined karate team, competed in John Ma Cup competition and got top-8 awards in individual and team events in 2020.
