Earlier experiences, and attempts.
A brief record is made here.
### 1. Research

* Universal Domain Adaptation --- with Zhangjie.

* Domain Generalization ---  with Yang Shu.



It was a pity that none of these methods worked out. But the most important thing is what I learned in the process -- how to get hands dirty and get things done. If one way doesn't work out, find another. Repeat it for 1,000 times.



### 2. Person I met

> I'm lucky to get to know them, the people who guided me so that I could find my way.

* Mrs. Wang.
  
  <!-- She’s the one who can actually look through me, and offer me advice that I needed the most.
  When she asked, *what kind of person you want to become*? I stumbled,  hearing my self saying I don’t know. But she spoke, ‘You do know, ... You want to be an interesting one. ’
 -->
* Mr. Fan.

  <!-- He is the one who tells me what does it mean to be an engineer in the first place. To find an elephant, and the refrigerator, and step by step work out what needs to be done to achieve my goal. -->

* Mr. Long.

  <!-- He is the one who shows me the passion for scientific research. And that it's not conflict with the short-term goal we target at. Just aim high and work hard. 🤟🏼✊🏼 -->

  

* Zhangjie,  Yang,  Ximei, Junguang, Haixu, Baixu, ... My first instructors who showed me what researchers are like :）

### 3. Life Pieces.

* Stood on the stage of the students festival.
* Launched Project P2P, a small but meaningful project that aimed at creating a platform to promote the communication between senior and junior students in Department of Automation. (Credit to JQK)
* Interviewed the alumni --- Xuehui Wang, Yu wang, ..., and learned from their experiences.
