* I am currently an undergraduate student studying at Department of Automation, **Tsinghua University** and with such  great  pleasure to be guided by Prof. [Mingsheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/), and Prof. [Xianyuan Zhan](http://zhanxianyuan.xyz/).

* My research interest lies in applying transfer learning into various applications, e.g. sim2real for reinforcement learning (RL) & imitation learning (IL). Real-world is where I believe scientific research should serve its purpose.ðŸ˜‰ **See more information in [Research Experiences](https://evieq01.github.io/evieqiu.github.io/experiences/) page.**

* I aim at persuing a **Ph.D degree** abroad, where I can get a chance to see a more colorful world, and eventually  from an active learner, to become an **active creater**.ðŸ› 

* A record of my wonderful campus life is [here](https://evieq01.github.io/evieqiu.github.io/life/). Never forget life is full of beautiful things and ready to be explored.
