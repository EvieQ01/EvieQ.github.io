* I am currently an first year master student studying at Department of Philosophy, **Carnegie Mellon University** and am with great  pleasure to be guided by Prof. [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/). I obtained my bachelor's degree at Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, mentored by Prof. [Mingsheng Long](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/), Prof. [Chao shang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=wsdfY3YAAAAJ) and Prof. [Xianyuan Zhan](http://zhanxianyuan.xyz/).

* My research interest lies in **causal discovery** and **control**. See more information in [Research Experiences](https://evieq01.github.io/evieqiu.github.io/experiences/) page.

* I aim at pursuing a **Ph.D. degree** , where I would get the chance to turn from a learner to a creater.

* A record of my wonderful campus life is [here](https://evieq01.github.io/evieqiu.github.io/life/). Don't forget life is full of beautiful things and ready to be explored!
