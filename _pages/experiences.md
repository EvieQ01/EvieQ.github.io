Research experiences
===
My research experience are listed as follows.
#### 1. Out-of-Dynamics (OOD) Imitation Learning from Transferable Demonstrations | March 2022 - now
> Advisor: Mingsheng Long, Tsinghua University

* Develop a tranferability measurement to down-weight non-transferable demonstrations for OOD imitation learning which enables robot to learn form data collected in different dynamics.

* Develop a novel sequence-based contrastive clustering algorithm to tackle the multimodal distribution in demonstrations to enhance the above adversarial training algorithm, and our final result outperforms all baselines.


#### 2. Dynamics-Aware Offline-and-Online                    Reinforcement Learning  |   Feb 2022 - April 2022
> Advisor: Xianyuan Zhan, Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University

* Propose the H2O framework to provide an affirmative answer to the question about how to integrate limited real data in offline RL and unrestricted exploration through imperfect simulators.

* By adaptively penalizes the Q-function learning on simulated state-action pairs with large dynamics gaps (through adversarial training), our result beats baselines in both simulation and real-world settings.


#### 3. Universal Domain Adaptation with Meta-learning | Aug 2021-Dec 2022
> Advisor: Mingsheng Long, Tsinghua University

* Aimed to eliminate the category gap on source and target domains in Domain Adaptation tasks by identifying outlier samples without the need for prior knowledge.

* Conducted experiments with PyTorch and achieved improved performance on Office31, OfficeHome settings. (1~2% in accuracy, 8% in h-score) by utilizing a meta-learning method, intended to consider harder circumstances like long-tail distribution in real-world settings.


#### 4. Modular Networks for Domain Generalization |    Nov 2021-Jan 2022
> Advisor: Mingsheng Long, Tsinghua University

* To enhance the models’ performance in unseen domain, design a modularized structure in deep neural networks to selectively produce knowledge in a more flexible way.

* Experimental results on OfficeHome and WILDS datasets show that the modularized design significantly boosts the performance in Domain Generalization tasks.

### What's more... Other interesting things I did in course projects.:)

#### Scenic spot guide based on Unitree Robotics A1 |   July 2021
> Special Operations Team, Tsinghua University
* Developed 4 functions with ROS system including: automatic navigation, human tracking, voice interaction and emergency management. 
* Integrated the system into a voice-conduct comprehensive product which could serve the purpose of a scenic spot guide.

#### Thunder-Classroom Application Development |          April 2020-June 2020

> Advisor: Jingtao Fan, Associate Professor, Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Department of Automation

* Built an online-meeting application aimed to serve as an online-classroom which resembles RainClassroom.

* Realized functions with GUI interface include: screen sharing, voice sharing, question attributing, etc. by C++ programming. Successfully used its release version to finish the project oral defense.

#### Video Desnowing with Speed and Effectiveness | High-tech Winter Olympics , July 2021-Aug 2021
> Advisor: Jianming Hu, Associate Professor, Institute of systems engineering, Department of Automation

* Focused on problems encountered when applying current vehicle recognition algorithms to real-life circumstances due to bad weather. Researched on traditional (dark channel; etc.) as well as deep learning methods (DesnowNet; etc.), which cannot promise speed and effectiveness at the same time.
* Proposed method based on Cycle GAN to promise better robustness on unseen circumstances and least-complexity for real-world implementation in Olympics Park.
