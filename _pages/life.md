## A memoir for the first semester of my junior year🤣

> ## Intro…

> * Heard from a friend that he was admitted to MIT. Material Science Ph.D. I felt happy for him!
> * Compared with receiving an offer, what I wished more for is finding the field of study that I love, just like him, although he joked that his major is one of ’The-4-Pitfalls’.

<!-- * From 2021/07, the moment I decided in an instance, jumped onto my bike,  rushed through the campus, knocked on that door, stepped into Mr. Long’s office,  I knew that my life has been on a new track.

### 1. Research

#### Universal Domain Adaptation --- working with Zhangjie

#### Domain Generalization --- working with Shu



It was a pity that none of these methods work out. But that's not the most important thing. The most important thing is what I learn in the process -- how to get hands dirty and get things done. If one way doesn't work out, find another. Repeat it for 1,000 times.



### 2. Person I met

> Grateful that I can get to know them.

* Mrs. Wang
  She’s the one who can actually look through me, and offer me advise that I needed the most.
  When she asked, *what kind of person you want to become*? I stumbled,  hearing my self saying I don’t know. But she spoke, ‘You do know, ... You want to be an interesting one:: ’

* Mr. Fan

  He is the one who tells me what does it mean to be an engineer in the first place. To find an elephant, and the refrigerator, and step by step work out what needs to be done to achieve my goal.

* Mr. Long

  He is the one who shows the passion for scientific research. And that it's not conflict with the short-term goal we target at. Just aim high and work hard. 🤟🏼✊🏼

  

* At last, all of the extraordinary senior who had guided me: Zhangjie,  Shu,  Ximei, Junguang,  Haixu, Baixu, ...
  Meeting these legendary people, was like a dream to me. Like finally meeting my idols. I don't have one though.  

### 3. Things I tried, those precious things.

* Standing on the stage of the students festival T-T
* Project P2P, as mysterious JQK, hhh.
* Meeting and making interviews with the experienced --- Xuehui Wang, Yu wang, ...

> Things I want to say at the end.
> Ask myself, ***what do I want, and how do I get there?***
