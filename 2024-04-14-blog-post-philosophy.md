> Philosophy is my medication. I must communicate with myself utilising philosophy if I am to understand my ego and use it for better. Otherwise, what's the point? Why live if you are only to bury your mind in the thoughts of others when there's a blazing universe to understand and explore, both internally and externally? 

--Travis J. Woods

This quote would be a perfect answer to the question of "Why do we study philosophy?" for me. But there's more than that.

## 1. Intro
It wasn't my intention to study philosophy, so I always had such question a in head. Why learn philosophy?. I brought it up to a couple of professors, and share some of the thoughts here :
* The first thing is, it's a challenge to your mind. Especially if you are trained to do engineering and you are already very good at it, you may be not good at reading, writing, arguing, etc. Therefore, doing philosophy is practicing critical thinking, which might be even harder than math and logic :) I'd like to give myself that challenge.   --Andy
* The second thing is, make sure you are using technology to do the right thing. Doing the right thing is not as simple as it seems. For example, modern medication is trying to cure diseases and expand human's life span -- but is it always good to live longer? How about lives' quality? And how to evaluate whether a life is satisfactory? Also, when the development of medication results in a more unequal distribution among the rich and poor, is it even a good thing?  --Andy
* It's really important to advance technology, to change the world, to save lives. We need new inventions, and new discoveries. But, we are having this conversation here because we care about philosophy. One needs to think broadly to have a big picture of the really big issues, and one also needs to be professional and go into technological details to make things happen. --Kun
* However, learning philosophy doesn't guarantee that you are able to do the right thing. Take the 20th century Germany as an example: they have the best philosophy thoughts, best artists, and the most advanced science. And what does that lead to? They inflicted the second world war. Genocide. You will learn more, but it doesn't lead to anything. In anyways, how much power does moral power have? --Clark
* Finally, just for fun. It's human nature to be curious, to ask questions, to know how and why, to be amazed by how people can understand things differently. At least, it is fun for me. --Me

## 2. Topics that I care about
  I intend to cover several topics that I've had thought about. I share my thoughts with you. These topics include:
  * Philosophy of science
    * Science comes from philosophy. David Hume [1] says that everything comes from experience, and nothing can be derived from human reasoning.
  * Race and gender justice
  * Social justice
  * Freedom
